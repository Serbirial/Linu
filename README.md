# Installing

At this point you should know how to run bots, as in not going to be explaining that

# Tags

First you need a tag channel.
Make a tag channel and copy the id.
Go to data open channels and paste it in.
Now all tag requests will go to that channel.

# Blacklisting users

Copy the users id.
Go to data then open blacklist.json and paste the users id, bam they cant use the bot.


# Emotes

Just replace the names with what you want
`\:emoji:` will get you a emoji id, copy and paste that into the file

# Config

Owners can do all commands(not moderation)
Admins cant do anything(*yet*) same for helpers
