## Installing

At this point you should know how to run bots, not going to be explaining that.

## Tags

1. First you need a tag channel.
2. Make a tag channel and copy the id.
3. Go to data open channels and paste it in.
4. Now all tag requests will go to that channel.

## Blacklisting users

1. Copy the user's id.
2. Go to [data](data), then open [blacklist.json](data/blacklist.json) and paste the user's id, *bam*, they can't use the bot.


## Emotes

Just replace the names with what you want.
`\:emoji:` will get you a emoji id, copy and paste that into the file

## Config

* Owners can do all commands (not moderation).
* Admins cant do anything *yet*, same for helpers.
